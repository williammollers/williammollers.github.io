I’m William, a Berliner with Australian and German roots who grew up in Sydney.

I relocated to Germany in 2009 to complete my degree in German Literature, History and Philosophy at the University of Cologne, and after graduating in 2011 promptly made my way to the big city.

The wonderful thing about Berlin is it’s incredibly complicated history mixed with it’s dynamic present. I love to engage the city’s thriving craft beer, specialty coffee and food scenes, as well as explore the city’s older quarters, particularly by bicycle.

One of my favourite routes to cycle is the ‘Mauerweg’ or the entire length of the Berlin Wall, something I do frequently and find an exhilarating way to experience the city’s history.

I've also become enamoured with Berlin's thriving tech scene and am keen on delving more into it.
